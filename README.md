# Wolf island
Wolf Island  OOP C++ test task

A 20x20 wolf island is populated by wild rabbits, wolves and wolves. There are several representatives of each species. Rabbits are rather unreasonable: at any given time, they are equally likely to move 1/9 into one of eight adjacent squares (except for areas bounded by the shoreline) or simply sit still. Each rabbit with probability 0.2 is converted into two rabbits. Each wolf moves randomly until a rabbit is hunted in one of the neighboring eight squares. If the wolf and the rabbit are in the same square, the wolf eats the rabbit and gets one point. And if not, she loses 0.1 points. Zero wolves and wolves die. At the initial time, all wolves and wolves have 1 point. The wolf behaves like a wolf until all the rabbits have disappeared in the neighboring squares; then, if the wolf is in one of the eight adjacent squares, the wolf chases after it. If a wolf and a wolf are found in one square and there is no rabbit to eat, they produce offspring of random sex. Program a predictable environmental model and monitor population change over a period of time.
